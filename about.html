The IEEE is the world’s largest professional association advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community to innovate for a better tomorrow through its highly-cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities. IEEE is the trusted “voice” for engineering, computing and technology information around the globe. 
<br /><br>

The IEEE is incorporated under the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law of the state of New York. It was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912) and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884).
Started in 1988, NITK IEEE has progressed exponentially and involved itself in various regional and global technical activities. Our effort has been fruitful in the form of various awards and laurels, the Best Student Branch Award (2007), GINI Student Branch Award (2010) and The Darrel Chong Student Activity Award (Silver Medal). Now one of the largest student branches worldwide, we are getting bigger and better.<br>
<br>

<font style="color:#18539b;"><b>Mission</b></font><br>

IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.<br>
<br>

<font style="color:#18539b;"><b>Vision</b></font><br>

IEEE will be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, and be universally recognized for the contributions of technology and of technical professionals in improving global conditions.<br><br>
The IEEE as a professional club provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology. The goal of the IEEE education programs is to ensure the growth of skill and knowledge in the electricity-related technical professions and to foster individual commitment to continuing education among IEEE members, the engineering and scientific communities, and the general public.<br><br>
NITK IEEE is recognized as a dynamic body of enthusiastic engineers with a passion to create change with innovation. With membership strength of 600, NITK IEEE strives towards excellence and justifies IEEE as a pioneer of technological innovations. NITK IEEE actively organizes intra-branch activities, institute level activities and actively participates in initiatives of its affinity groups such as WIE (Women in Engineering) and SIGHT (Special Interest Group for Humanitarian Technologies). NITK IEEE's participation in GINI (Global Integrated Network of IEEE) has been of great importance to the growth of the student branch. <br><br>
NITK IEEE provides its student members with good platforms for sharing knowledge and implementing technology in practical projects through Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The primary SIGs of NITK IEEE are: Diode, Piston and Python.<br>
<br>

<b>In broad terms the objectives of the club are:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>	Add on to the student member benefits by involving student members in different innovative projects and research.
<li>	Improve global presence of the student chapter by taking part in international competitions, conferences and talks.
<li>	Act as an effective platform to share and build technical knowledge inside the college and support
</ul>
