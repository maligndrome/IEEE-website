<font style="color:#18539b;">Piston</font> is a special interest group dedicated to the engineering applications of Mechanical, Automation, Civil, Chemical and Material Sciences. The SIG functions as a platform for students interested in learning and advancing specific areas of knowledge and technology. The SIG members co-operate, communicate, and organise meets, talks and conferences to discuss latest technology advancement and application. The SIG talks and seminars are given for encompassing the real world applications, which bring together all eager learners. Workshops are regularly held to equip members with software skills like MATLAB, ANSYS, CATIA, AutoCAD etc. The SIG is an excellent forum to interact with experienced seniors and professionals. <br>

Piston SIG collaborates with other SIG’s i.e. Diode and Python in learning and advancing in interdisciplinary areas such as Robotics, Mechatronics, Microcontrollers and Automation. The SIG also collaborates with SIGHT Chapter to discuss possible technological solutions for humanitarian application.<br>

The SIG consists of 2 societies namely Mach (Mechanical, Automation and Chemical Engineering) and RAS (Robotics and Automation). The specific areas of technology in Piston can be classified as follows -<br>
<ul>
 
<li>	Aerospace Engineering
<li>	Automobile engineering
<li>	Bio-Mechanical Applications
<li>	Chemical and Thermal Engineering
<li>	Heat and Renewable Energy Engineering
<li>	Robotics, Controls and Mechatronics
<li>	Structures and Materials
</ul>

<font style="color:#18539b; font-size:18px;"><b>
RC Plane</b></font><br>
Designing, analysing and producing an RC plane. This involves understanding the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the plane, choosing the right motors, controllers for its operations and making it fly. The project involved optimization of various parameters for an enhanced flight. The project was to explain the systematic methodology followed for designing, analysing and building the RC plane including details of optimization.<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#18539b; font-size:18px;"><b>
Bike Simulator</b></font><br>

The main aim of the project is to develop a control prototype model of a two wheeler. The project involved mathematically modelling and simulating a two wheeled vehicle in a virtual world through computation of dynamic equations. MiL (Model-in-the-loop) and HiL (Hardware-in-the-loop) tests are conducted to validate the controller and the model. The VR-Sink block in Simulink simulates the bike in virtual world. <br>

Synthesis of Nanoparticles from Commercial Bio-waste
</b></font><br>
 This project was directed towards synthesizing nanoparticles viz. ZnO from commercial bio waste (Areca nut). To start with, we experimented on sources that had already been worked upon, like teak leaves, badam leaves, coconut husk and date seeds; and successfully obtained the Ag, ZnO, Fe nanoparticles.<br>
