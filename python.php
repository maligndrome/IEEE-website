Women Safety App</b></font><br>

A mobile application that aims to improve the standards of safety for women by providing them with a reliable way to place an emergency call. The model has a straightforward interface that achieves its intended purpose by allowing the user to easily trigger the calling function by shaking the phone. A message containing the geographical location of the user at the time at which the alarm is triggered, as well as contact details of a pre-selected list of emergency contacts, is immediately sent to the police.

GREEN COMPUTING
</b></font><br>

The Green Computing Project focuses on finding the carbon footprint of a given computer.  The  energy  consumption  by  various  components  of  the  system  like  graphics  card, hard drive, and monitor is found and converted to equivalent carbon consumption. A shell script for calculating these parameters will be run on computers in various laboratories across campus.<br>
