<hr>

<font style="font-size:18px">
Community service agencies face a future in which they must take advantage of technology to improve, coordinate, account for, and deliver the services they provide. They need the help of people with strong technical backgrounds. Undergraduate students face a future in which they will need more than solid expertise in their discipline to succeed. They will be expected to work with people of many different backgrounds to identify and achieve goals. They need educational experiences that can help them broaden their skills.<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#18539b; font-size:24px;"><b>Projects</b></font><br><br>

As part of the Engineering Projects In Community Service (EPICS) proposal, the following assistive softwares for visually impaired were developed by the NITK IEEE members.<br><br>


<font style="color:#18539b"><b>Guess the number</b></font><br>
The objective of the game is to guess the number chosen by the computer in a given range. The player enters a number and the computer guides the player through indicating whether the entered number is greater than or lesser than the given number till the game ends with the input of right number. The aim is to guess the number in minimum no of trials. The game is developed on Scratch, a free and open source software with audio outputs, both English and regional language, Kannada making it easier for the visually impaired students to use as well.<br>

<font style="color:#18539b"><b>ILLUMINATE-A Quizzing software for visually impaired</b></font><br>


Illuminate is multipurpose Quizzing assistance software aimed at improving the learning experience of the visually impaired students. It converts textual questions into speech and quizzes the student. It can be used in a wide variety of applications to develop interactive learning experience. The quiz is multiple choice type with four options and the score is calculated after ever y question.<br>

<font style="color:#18539b"><b>Co-ordinate Geometry Aid in Scratch</b></font><br>


The software is created using Scratch, a free and open source software. It is built to assist the visually impaired and visually impaired visualize the coordinate system and orientation of objects in 2D space. As the visually impaired are unable to physically see the position of objects in space, teaching them coordinate geometry is more challenging. This software helps the user visualize the given points and then judge the shape. It offers a wide range of problems with varying levels of difficulty. For each question, suitable options are given out of which one will be the correct answer. Instructions, questions, options are all read out. For making the software more user-friendly, two versions have been made; one in English and the other in the regional language, Kannada.<br>

<font style="color:#18539b"><b>Unscramble it</b></font>

Unscramble is a sound based game developed for visually impaired students to help them play with words without having to use Braille script as a medium. The game helps them enhance their vocabulary. The computer generates a jumbled word and reads out each alphabet to the player. A hint is played with every word to help the player unscramble the word and type in the correct word. Scores are calculated according to the level of difficulty. The game is totally keyboard based and has a GUI to help a teacher expand the database and add more words.<br>

<font style="color:#18539b"><b>Soundbird</b></font><br>


SoundBird is a sound recognition game developed especially for visually impaired children studying in primary grades. The game plot is simple where a player hears a sound and is required to recognize the origin of the sound. The sounds played are of birds, animals and transportation vehicles. The game lets a player repeat the sound for two incorrect attempts after which the answer is spoken out. Then a short introduction of the bird, animal or vehicle is given to let them learn more about the world around them. The whole game is keyboard controlled and uses text to speech analyzer to speak out sentences. The game sharpens the perceptive skills of the player and can be used to improve general knowledge. More sounds can be added to the game by a teacher later to increase the diversity of sounds.<br>

<font style="color:#18539b"><b>ViMath</b></font><br>


ViMath is a simple math tutor, aimed at helping the visually impaired students hone their mathematical skills. The software reads out options to the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. On selecting which it reads out a problem to the user and they key in the answer. If the user types an incorrect answer, it reads out the correct answer with step by step explanation.<br>
