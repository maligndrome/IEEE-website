NITK IEEE SIGHT(<i>Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology</i>)</font> is a group that caters to the guiding philosophy of IEEE -‘Advancing Technology for Humanity’. We believe that the problems of today can be solved effectively through technology. So, we take up activities that benefit the society directly.<br/><br/><br/> We focus on taking up projects in the open-source platforms. This helps us drive down the cost of the final product and make the solution affordable to a large section of people.<br/><br/> Our current focus is on providing educational solutions because we believe that a revolutionary change in the educational system would bring about a revolutionary change in the society.<br/><br/> Talking about our achievements, one of the most successful projects in the NIT-K IEEE Student Chapter was the ‘Smart SlateProject’. It focused on designing a smart tactile interface that could be used to assist blind students in learning about various 3-D shapes.<br/><br/>

SIGHT is supported by the other SIGs – Circuits and Systems Society (CAS), Computer Society, Signal Processing Society (SPS), Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) & Mechanical Automation and Chemical SIG (MACh). Thanks to a strong and dedicated multi-disciplinary team, we have been successful in doing projects that have a real positive impact!<br>

<font style="color:#18539b; font-size:24px;"><b>Projects</b></font><br>
<br>

<b>Suture Strength measurement</b><br>

The project involves building a device to measure the strength of a sample suture(artificial tendon replacement) could tolerate by applying stress across it. The device will have to provide a continuous reading of the stress applied and record it when the suture breaks. So, it will help doctors to decide in recommending sutures for patients<br>
<br>
<b>Nerve Fibre joining simulator</b><br>

The project involves building a system to test and train medical students to join a broken nerve fibre. A nerve fibre contains a set of 6-8 bundles which need to be aligned symmetrically to get a correct joint,for the message signal to travel across the nerve bundles.The corrected joint doesn't require the nerve ends to touch. So the system will have to simulate these nerve fibres and quantify the error in the joint made i.e how much of the message signal may flow across the nerve fibre.Each bundle of nerves will have to face the correct bundle on the other face of the nerve fault.<br>
<br>
<b>Backbone curve quantification</b><br>

Every individual's backbone has a curved structure and a curvature when he/she stands against the wall. This project involves making a product to find out this curve for any individual, give a graphical output about the curve and quantise it,i.e make it comparable to standard healthy backbone curve shapes. This information can help diagnose any backbone imperfections and allow the surgeon to use appropriate surgery methods.<br>
<br>
<b>Walk characteristics logging device</b><br>

The project involves building a system to log,display and quantify the shoulder tilt, sole contact with the ground(time the feet sole is in contact with the ground for) to diagnose walking disorders and analyse treatment results.<br>
